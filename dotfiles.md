# Dotfiles

I'm going to using chezmoi to manage my dotfiles. I'm also thinking about
ansibe, but I'm not sure yet.

What is chezmoi?

- chezmoi is a cli tool that manage your dotfiles across multiple machines,
  securely.

install chezmoi

initalize chezmoi: chezmoi init

add a file to chezmoi: chezmoi add ~/.bashrc
