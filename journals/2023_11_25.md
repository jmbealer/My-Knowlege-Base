- All computers have four basic functions: input, processing, output, and storage
	- **Inputs** are information received by a computer.
		- A computer cannot perform a function until it receives input.
		- The computer must translate the data from input into binary code, so the computer can either store or process it
	- **Processing** is the series of actions that a computer takes when it receives data.
	- **Output** is the result of the computer transforming input data, through processing, into usable information.
	- **Storage** refers to how a device retains information.
