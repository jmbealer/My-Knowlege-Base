# 2023-12-06

testing out `nb` as a note take solution:

* [nb](https://github.com/xwmx/nb)

trying copilot:

* have it installed in neovim.
* have it installed on cli, using gh copilot still need to try it out.

look into `motion canvas`

can use to improve browser experience
[vieb examples keybinds](https://github.com/Jelmerro/Vieb/tree/master/app/examples)

maybe look into `just` cli
