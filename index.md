This is the beginning of my wiki/personal-site/portfolio.

There many things I need to do to get this site up and running. I need to:

- [ ] Clean up my notes.
- [ ] Add my resume.
- [ ] Add my projects.
- [ ] Pick a color scheme.
- [ ] Work on the design of the site.

See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.

Who, What, Where, When, Why, Which, Whom, Whose
